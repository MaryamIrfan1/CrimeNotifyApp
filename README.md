# AI-Powered Crime Reporting & Dispatch Optimization System

An intelligent **Flutter-based crime reporting and police dispatch platform** that uses **AI, algorithms, and geospatial analysis** to prioritize incidents, detect crime hotspots, and optimize officer response in real time.

This project focuses on **practical AI engineering**, demonstrating how machine learning concepts and optimization algorithms can be applied to real-world public safety systems.

---

## 🚓 Project Overview

Traditional crime reporting systems rely heavily on manual prioritization and delayed decision-making. This system improves emergency response by:

* Automatically prioritizing crime reports using AI-based scoring
* Identifying crime hotspots through clustering techniques
* Optimizing police dispatch to minimize response time
* Providing real-time dashboards for command-level monitoring

The goal is to make emergency response **faster, smarter, and data-driven**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-time crime reporting** using Firebase
* **AI-based priority scoring** for incidents
* **Crime hotspot detection** using clustering algorithms
* **Optimized police dispatch** based on distance and workload
* **ETA calculation** for response units
* **Risk prediction** using spatial crime density
* **Central command dashboard** for live monitoring
